/**
 * The public site is a template, and it once shipped with its Work and Testimonials sections

 *
 * So the profile carries **no** client outcome and **no** human endorsement: its proof strip states
 * how the agency works, in sentences a visitor can hold it to, and the page renders exactly the
 * sections plan §2.5 names — from the profile it is handed, which is what `GET /api/site` serves.
