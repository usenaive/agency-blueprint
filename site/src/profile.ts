/**
 * The page's copy comes from `GET /api/site` — the `site_profile` the crew edits and the operator
 * approves — so a visitor sees what was approved, not what was compiled. The route is public and
 * same-origin, so this is one fetch with no bearer. When it cannot be read (local preview with no
 * server, a host mid-deploy) the compiled seed stands in: the page never renders blank. Nor does it
 * render a shape the sections were not written for: a section the reply lacks, or has in another
 * shape than the seed's, is the seed's — the store refuses such a write, so this is only ever
 * another server's reply, and the page cannot throw on it.
