/**
 * THE SEED OF THE PUBLIC SITE. The site is data: this object is the `site_profile` record the
 * dashboard store is created with (once, for the active template), the public site renders
 * whatever `GET /api/site` answers, and the site-builder agent rewrites it from the setup answers
 * through `dashboard.update_site` — every change waiting for the operator's approval. Components
 * never hard-code copy; they read the profile and nothing else.
 *
 * What the agency *does* is not written here twice: the hero, the services and the footer are the
 * active template's (`templates/index.ts`), so the public site sells the same specialism the
 * dashboard runs, and switching template changes both. Everything below that — your name, your
 * palette, your process and your prices — is a generic starting point the crew replaces.
 *
 * One rule that is not about taste: the proof strip carries facts about how the agency works and
 * **no number**, and there is no case study and no testimonial. A result is a factual claim about
 * someone else's business and a quote is words in a named person's mouth, so this template
 * carries neither — an unedited deploy must never publish client work nobody did.
