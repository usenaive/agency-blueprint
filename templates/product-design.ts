/**
 * `product-design` — the agency machine run as a studio for physical products.
 *
 * It is NOT a delta on `blank` the way `seo-geo` is. A product studio does not need a site writer,
 * a sales seat or a content calendar; it needs four seats that turn a brief into files:
 *
 *   * `account-manager` — the studio lead. Day one it writes the STUDIO NOTE from the four setup
 *     answers, before any other seat makes anything, then hands ONE first brief to the designer.
 *     Every later brief is read against that note and routed: millimetres to the engineer, a look to
 *     the designer, a video to the visualizer once the look or part exists.
 *   * `designer` — one `generate_3d_model` per look (a textured GLB, no units). Never `build_3d`.
 *   * `engineer` — `build_3d` with `engine: "cad"`, only for a brief that names millimetres, and only
 *     a watertight solid within 0.5 mm of the brief is filed. Never `generate_3d_model`.
 *   * `visualizer` — one studio still per look, and the product video only when the brief asks
 *     (`generate_video` stays at `ask`).
 *
 * Every file is filed as ONE pending deliverable on the `studio` channel with its `fil_` ids
 * (`create_draft_post`'s `files`), which the dashboard's Studio screen shows and the operator
 * approves. Approving a studio deliverable posts nothing anywhere (`server/routes.ts`); nothing here
 * holds an outward tool at `allow`.
 *
 * The machinery — model, budget, deny-by-default `tools()`, `crm()`, the persona, the timer helper,
 * the gate every prompt carries — is `templates/agents.ts`'s, shared with the other two templates.
