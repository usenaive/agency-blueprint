/**
 * *** THE TEMPLATE HAS TO REACH THE BUNDLE, AND FOR A LONG TIME IT DID NOT. ***
 *
 * `templates/index.ts` picks `TEMPLATE` from `process.env["NAIVE_TEMPLATE"]`, and that module is
 * the screens' and the public site's as much as the config's. In Node the read works, which is why
 * `naive.config.ts` reported the right template and the catalog row said `blank`. In a client
 * bundle it does not: Vite compiles a bare `process.env` to `{}`, so the screens read `undefined`
 * and fell back to this repository's default. Measured on the published catalog, `blank@0.1.0` and
 * `seo-geo@0.1.0` shipped the SAME dashboard digest and the SAME site digest — two rows, one pair
 * of trees, and an operator installing `blank` got Meridian Search's search agency instead.
 *
 * A unit test on `ACTIVE` cannot see this: it runs in Node, where the read has always worked. Only
 * the emitted bytes can, so this builds them — the one build this blueprint ships, which carries
 * two pages: the public site at `/` and the operator dashboard under `/app`.
