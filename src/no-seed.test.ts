/**
 * The deployed dashboard must never present sample rows as the operator's data (ADR-0374).
 *
 * This guard used to be a regex over import statements, and it was walked round twice: once with
 * the explicit `.ts` extension that `server/store.ts` itself writes, once with a multi-line import
 * (the pattern was `/gm`, so `.` never crossed the newline). Import *syntax* is not the thing that
 * matters, so this asks the only question that does — does a seed row reach the asset the
 * deployment serves? It bundles `src/main.tsx` the way the build does and then checks both the
 * module graph (no template module that carries a seed compiled in) and the emitted JavaScript (no
 * seed row id in the text).
 *
 * The demo rows are template data and live with their template, so this is also the line between
 * the two halves of `templates/`: the screens may read `templates/index.ts` — kinds, words, site
 * copy — and may never reach the modules below, which the config and the server import.
 *
 * `import type` is erased by the compiler and leaves neither behind, so it stays legal. Every value
 * import does, whatever its spelling — and so does a hand-pasted copy of the rows, which no import
 * regex could ever have caught.
