 * screen means an empty store — which is the truth about a new deployment.

 * it stopped being one: the platform generates it (`canonical-spec §29.7`) and no route returns it,
 * so there is no value for a person to be asked for. What replaced the box is one click in the
 * studio, which posts a short-lived ticket to `/api/enter`; the server answers with an `HttpOnly`
 * cookie the browser then attaches to every same-origin call below on its own.
 *
 * So no `authorization` header is sent, and a 401 is not a prompt any more — it is the honest
 * sentence the server wrote, rendered by whichever screen asked.
