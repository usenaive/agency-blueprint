/**
 * The **deployed** dashboard's whole server: one function behind `/api/app`, serving `/mcp` and
 * every `/api/*` route from the same document (ADR-0374).
 *
 * `server/index.ts` serves the identical route table for `pnpm serve`, over a JSON file. A deployed
 * app has no durable disk and no long-lived process, so this one keeps the document in the app
 * database the platform provisions for a `fullstack` app (`DATABASE_URL`, server-set) and owns it
 * for the length of one request: load once, hand `handleRequest` a store over `openStoreOver`,
 * write back once and only when something changed.
 *
 * One `pg.Client` per invocation, never a `Pool`: an instance serves one request and is frozen
 * between them, so a pooled connection is a leaked backend on the database. The connection is
 * opened lazily, on the first `ctx.store()` call, so `/api/chat`, `/api/agents` and `/api/social/*`
 * open none at all.
 *
 * The whole request is **one transaction over the locked document row**. It used to be a plain
 * read-modify-write, which for a single jsonb row is last-write-wins: eight parallel `create_lead`
 * calls each answered 200 and six clients survived, an agent's write vanishing with no error
 * anywhere. `select … for update` in `begin` holds the row for the length of the request, so the
 * next writer reads what the last one wrote. Serialising costs nothing here — the writers are one
 * operator and their own agents — and the upgrade is still real tables, which starts by replacing
 * this file's queries.
